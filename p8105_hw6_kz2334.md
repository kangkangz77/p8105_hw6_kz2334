Problem 1
---------

Import the data.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Create a city\_state variable, and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved.

``` r
homicide_data = homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         status = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), 0, 1))
```

Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake.

``` r
homicide_data = homicide_data %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Tulsa, AL"))) %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"),
          victim_race = as.factor(victim_race), 
            victim_race = relevel(victim_race, ref = "white"))
  
```
